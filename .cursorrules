# Cursor Rules for City of David Project

## Database Migrations

When adding new database migrations, follow this procedure:

1. **Link your project** (if not already linked):

   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref jcqeyomapnjpvbxobveo
   ```

2. **Create a new migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration new new-migration
   ```
   Replace `new-migration` with a descriptive name for your migration.

## Notes

- Migrations are stored in the `supabase/migrations/` directory
- Migration files should be numbered sequentially (e.g., `004_new_feature.sql`)
- Always test migrations in a development environment before applying to production
